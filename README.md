# TraceOn
A Minecraft mod inspired by Emiya from Fate/stay night.

Added a "trace" system for minecraft you can make a copy of swords(and other tools if configured). 
But copies tend to be worse. They will have less durability, only exist for a short time .etc
All of these can be configured by yourself.
